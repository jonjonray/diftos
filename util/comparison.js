var diff = function(before, after) {
    /*
        Find the differences between two lists. Returns a list of pairs, where the
        first value is in ['+','-','='] and represents an insertion, deletion, or
        no change for that list. The second value of the pair is the list
        of elements.
        Params:
            before  the old list of immutable, comparable values (ie. a list
                    of strings)
            after   the new list of immutable, comparable values
        Returns:
            A list of pairs, with the first part of the pair being one of three
            strings ('-', '+', '=') and the second part being a list of values from
            the original before and/or after lists. The first part of the pair
            corresponds to whether the list of values is a deletion, insertion, or
            unchanged, respectively.

            diff([1,2,3,4],[1,3,4])
